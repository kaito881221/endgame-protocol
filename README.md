1.	Introduction: The Rise of a New Paradigm
1.1	The Market's Limit: Sleeping Assets and Collapsing Economies
While the cryptocurrency market has shown explosive growth over the past decade, suggesting a new future for finance, the pace of innovation has slowed, and the paradigm is now stagnating. Investors are struggling to find new value, and the established formulas for success are clearly revealing their limitations.
The 'HODL' strategy, once a powerful conviction for early market participants, is no longer sufficient. Under this paradigm, assets lie dormant on the blockchain, engaging in no value-creating activities. Their appreciation depends solely on the whims of the external market and vague expectations. This is not active value creation but passive waiting, offering no defensive measures during a market downturn.
GameFi, the Play-to-Earn (P2E) model that emerged to overcome this passivity, has also hit a fundamental wall. Most P2E projects adopted inflationary economic models, endlessly issuing reward tokens to attract new users. This ultimately created a structural problem where the funds from new entrants are used to pay the rewards of earlier participants. The moment this inflow of new users ceased, these ecosystems began to collapse. The 'fun'—the essence of gaming—disappeared, leaving only 'labor' and 'chores' in the pursuit of rewards.
Ultimately, the current market is trapped in a dilemma, caught between the two extremes of 'passive holding' and 'unsustainable inflationary rewards'. Assets lie dormant while ecosystems self-destruct.
It is time for a new set of rules.

1.2	The Fundamental Question: Why Are Your Assets Inactive? 
Even at this very moment, your digital assets lie dormant within the digital vault of your wallet. Their value is swayed only by the winds of the external market, afforded no opportunity to prove their own worth. You are merely an 'owner,' not a 'participant' in the creation of its value.
We must ask this fundamental question: Why must your assets lie dormant?
The logic of the traditional financial system treats assets as passive objects. However, the true potential of blockchain technology lies in transforming every participant into an active agent. The value of an asset should not be derived from mere possession, but must be created through 'Action' taken with that asset.
Trading, staking, community participation, governance voting... all of these are clear actions that contribute to the ecosystem. So, how should the value of these actions be proven?
Endgame Protocol begins at this very point. We present a new perspective where every action taken by a market participant becomes value itself. Your active engagement is the engine that brings the ecosystem to life, and your contribution rightfully deserves to be rewarded by the appreciation of the entire system.
We are here to declare an end to the era of dormant assets and to usher in an age of 'awakened' assets.

1.3	Our Answer: The Birth of Survival Finance (SuFi)
To solve the dilemma of 'dormant assets' and 'unsustainable economies,' we propose a completely new paradigm. The name of this path pioneered by Endgame Protocol is Survival Finance (SuFi).
We are the first to define SuFi as follows:
Survival Finance (SuFi) is a dynamic economic system where value is redistributed and maximized through participant survival and competition.
SuFi completely overturns existing financial models.
•	Difference from HODL: In SuFi, merely ‘holding’ is no longer a virtue. ‘Survival’ is the only proof of value. Your assets are no longer dormant; every action taken to survive becomes the very process of protecting and growing their value.
•	Difference from GameFi: SuFi rejects the inflationary models that dilute value through infinite token issuance. Instead, it redistributes value to the survivors through a deflationary model that burns inactive assets. Rewards are not generated externally; they are seized through competition within the system.
SuFi is more than just an investment or a game; it is a grand social experiment that integrates the most primal human instinct—'survival'—into a financial system. Every participant must prove their strategy and skill within a set of rules designed to be fair and transparent.
Endgame Protocol is the first proof of this new genre, SuFi.

1.4	The Ultimate Vision: A Living, Decentralized Economic Game 
Our ultimate vision is as follows:
To build the most transparent, fair, and immersive decentralized economic game on the blockchain.
This vision is built upon three core principles:
•	Radical Transparency: All rules within the Endgame Protocol are written as publicly verifiable smart contract code. This eliminates arbitrary intervention from any centralized entity and ensures there are no hidden rules; everything is published and executed transparently on the blockchain.
•	Provable Fairness: The laws of SuFi apply equally to all. Regardless of the size of your assets or your time of entry into the market, survival is determined solely by your activity and strategy. Here, Code is Law.
•	Deep Immersion: We do not want you to be a passive observer who only watches charts. Endgame Protocol is a grand strategy game designed to stimulate your intellect, psychology, and survival instincts. Every decision you make will create ripples throughout the ecosystem, and its consequences will directly impact your assets, delivering an unparalleled level of immersion.
Endgame Protocol is more than just a token project; it is a living economic ecosystem, built and shaped by its community. We are not recruiting investors; we are seeking players who will join us in forging the rules of a new financial paradigm.


1.5	A Message from the First Survivor: Why must we assign value to that which stands still? 
I have been an observer of the cryptocurrency market for a long time. Initially, I was captivated by the revolutionary ideal of decentralization, but as time went on, a profound question began to haunt my thoughts: Why must we assign value to assets that do nothing, that simply lie dormant?
In the laws of nature, everything that ceases to move is destined for obsolescence and decay. The only things that survive are those that constantly adapt, compete, and prove their existence. Yet, the world of cryptocurrency was the exact opposite. The highest virtue was to simply 'HODL' more assets—in other words, to do nothing at all.
I believed this was unsustainable. I believed that true value must be proven not through passive possession, but through the process of active engagement and fierce survival.
Endgame Protocol is my answer, born from that conviction.
This is not a project to create just another coin. It is a grand social experiment that asks the most fundamental question: "Where does value come from?" I dreamed of a world where every participant, under fair and transparent laws, must mobilize all their strategy and wisdom to prove their survival. A living organism where only code and the competition of its participants exist, without any central intervention.
This whitepaper is the first map into that world. I sincerely hope you will join us on this journey, declare an end to the era of passive wealth, and become another survivor in a new paradigm where you prove your value through your actions.
– From the First Survivor

2.	Competitive Analysis: Discovering a New Opportunity
In Chapter 1, we discussed 'why' a new paradigm is necessary.
Now, in Chapter 2, we will prove the unique position of Endgame Protocol through market analysis. This is more than a simple competitive analysis; it is the story of the massive opportunity we have discovered and the inevitability of SuFi.
2.1.	Market Limitations and Opportunities
As of 2025, the Decentralized Finance (DeFi) and Game Finance (GameFi) markets have grown into massive ecosystems worth hundreds of billions of dollars. However, despite this quantitative growth, both sectors have hit fundamental limitations in sustainability, revealing a structural void in the market. Assets in the DeFi ecosystem largely remain 'passive assets,' dormant for the purpose of yield farming, while the GameFi ecosystem has suffered from the failure of hyper-inflationary models based on the infinite issuance of reward tokens. 
The market now craves a sustainable system that generates value through the active engagement of its participants, moving beyond models that simply copy money (DeFi) or reward tedious labor (GameFi). It is at this very point that the opportunity for Endgame Protocol begins.

2.2.	Competitive Landscape Analysis 
Endgame Protocol does not directly compete with existing DeFi or GameFi projects; rather, it occupies a unique position above them, presenting a new set of rules for the game.
•	DeFi Protocols (e.g., Uniswap, Aave): These focus on providing liquidity and financial efficiency. However, they treat participants' assets merely as 'passive collateral' and fail to incentivize active, strategic 'actions' with those assets.
•	GameFi Platforms (e.g., Axie Infinity, etc.): While they successfully onboarded numerous users to Web3 with the 'Play-to-Earn' model, most failed to prove long-term viability due to unsustainable reward systems. The essence of gaming, 'fun,' disappeared, leaving only the objective of 'profit,' which led to the collapse of their ecosystems.
Category	Decentralized Finance (DeFi)	Game Finance (GameFi)	SuFi

Core Value	Liquidity, Financial Efficiency	Play-to-Earn (P2E)	Proof of Survival, Practical Utility
Economic Model	Inflationary (Liquidity Mining)	Hyper-Inflationary (Reward Tokens)	Deflationary (Burn Mechanism), External Capital Inflow (DeFi Integration)
Participant Role	Passive Liquidity Provider	Laborer, Gamer	Active Player, Strategist, DeFi Participant
Sustainability	Rewards diminish in downturns	Collapses when user growth stops	Value Concentration upon Ecosystem Activation, DeFi Revenue Generation Basis

2.3.	The Unique Position of Endgame Protocol 
Endgame Protocol combines the concept of 'assets' from DeFi and 'competition' from GameFi, but solves their fundamental weaknesses with the powerful weapon of 'sustainable deflation.'
•	Sustainable Deflationary Economy: We increase the scarcity and value of the token solely through an internal mechanism—the burning of inactive assets—without relying on the inflow of external capital.
•	Valuing Active Participation: We assign value not to the passive act of holding (HODL), but to all 'active engagements' undertaken to avoid the burn.
•	Value Redistribution for Participants: The value that disappears through the burn is not taken by a third party; it is fully redistributed to the 'survivors' who remain and stay active until the end.
We are not building just another DeFi or GameFi project. We are creating the first 'self-regulating' economic organism that purifies and evolves itself through the competition of its participants.

3.	Endgame Protocol: Survive and Prove
In Chapter 1, we discussed 'why' a new paradigm is necessary. Now, in Chapter 2, we present our answer: 'Endgame Protocol.' We will explain in detail what it is, how it works, and why it can be trusted. This is more than a mere project introduction; it is a guide to the laws of the new world you are about to enter.

3.1.	The Project's Identity: The Coin Itself is the Game
Endgame Protocol is the world's first Survival Finance (SuFi) protocol and a grand, decentralized economic game unfolding on the blockchain. We are ending the era of passive holding (HODL) and proposing a new dimension of digital economy where every action a participant takes leads to survival and the proof of value. 
In the Endgame Protocol ecosystem, the single, absolute principle of 'inactive assets are burned' is enforced by the smart contract. Therefore, participants are no longer passive investors but are transformed into 'players' who must constantly devise optimal strategies to protect and grow their assets. The ultimate survivor of this fierce competition will be the one who proves all value.

3.2.	The Core Mechanism: Those Who Do Not Act, Perish
The core of Endgame Protocol is an endless economic survival game named 'The Last Survivor.' The sole and absolute rule of this game is this: "If you are inactive, you are burned."
In the traditional financial system, it was sufficient to simply keep your assets secure. In Endgame Protocol, however, it is different. Your assets must constantly prove their reason for existence. The assets in a wallet where no activity is detected for a set period are automatically burned by a predetermined percentage, permanently vanishing from the ecosystem.
This mechanism is not merely a penalty. It is the heart of the system, preventing stagnation and perpetually circulating value.

•	Preventing Sleeping Whales: Passively holding a large number of tokens does not contribute to the ecosystem. Our rules compel every participant to be active, without exception.
•	Deeper Strategy and Competition: Participants must not only perform basic activities like trading or staking to avoid the burn, but they must also become daring hunters who find and attack other inactive players during the 'Pillage Night.' Furthermore, they must engage in a high-level psychological war where they cannot be complacent for a moment, deciding when to use strategic items like the 'Survivor's Sigil' NFT and what information to gather with the 'Shards of Foresight.'
•	Rewarding the Survivors: The burned tokens lead to a reduction in the total supply, creating a powerful deflationary effect that increases the scarcity of tokens held by the surviving, active participants.
In Endgame Protocol, you are not a mere observer of your assets, but a player whose every decision is directly tied to survival.

3.3.	Absolute Fairness: Code is Law 
The prerequisite for an economic game with such radical and harsh rules is singular: absolute trust. And the only technology that can guarantee that trust is the blockchain.
If Endgame Protocol were a typical game run on centralized servers, you would always be suspicious. "What if the developers secretly change the rules?" or "What if the rules are unfairly applied only to me?"
The blockchain eliminates all such doubts at their source.
•	
•	Transparency: All the rules of the game, including the logic of 'when, how, and how much' will be burned, are written in smart contract code that is publicly verifiable on the blockchain. There are no hidden rules or exceptions.
•	Fairness: The rules, executed by smart contracts, apply to everyone with 100% fairness and without exception. Not even the development team can intervene or grant favors to specific individuals. The code is simply executed mechanically and impartially as written. Code is Law.
•	Trustlessness: You do not need to trust the Endgame Protocol team. You only need to trust the publicly-verified code that has been mathematically proven. This is the power of a decentralized system, maintained solely by the interactions of its participants without any central administrator.
In conclusion, blockchain is not an 'option' for Endgame Protocol; it is the 'indispensable foundation' that makes the project's very existence possible.

4.	The Laws of the Game: Essential Strategies for Survival 
To survive in Endgame Protocol, every participant must understand and utilize the three fundamental laws. These are not mere recommendations; they are absolute rules enforced by the smart contract.

4.1.	The First Law - The Burn: The Price of Inactivity
The heart of Endgame Protocol, and its most critical law, is 'The Burn.' The burn is the core mechanism that prevents stagnation in the ecosystem and redistributes value to its active participants.
•	Definition of 'Inactive Wallet': Endgame Protocol defines an 'Inactive Wallet' as a wallet that has not initiated any outbound transactions for a period of 30 days (720 hours) or more since its last outbound transaction. Inbound transactions do not affect the inactive status. Only actions that actively move, stake, or use assets are recognized as 'activity.'
•	Burn Cycle and Rate: Every Sunday at 00:00 UTC, the protocol will automatically scan the activity status of all wallets. For any wallet classified as an 'Inactive Wallet' at this time, 10% of the total [$EGP] tokens it holds will be immediately burned. This process repeats weekly, meaning once a wallet becomes inactive, its assets will decrease every week until activity is resumed.
•	Handling of Burned Tokens: Tokens designated for burning are immediately sent to a burn address. A burn address is an address for which no one holds the private key, making it permanently irrecoverable. This process fundamentally prevents the burned tokens from re-entering the market circulation, which means the total supply is permanently reduced. As a result, the scarcity and value of the tokens held by the surviving, active participants will naturally increase. All burn records will be transparently published on the blockchain for anyone to verify.

4.2.	The Second Law - Proof of Activity: The Act of Survival
If the First Law, 'The Burn,' is the price of inactivity, then the Second Law, 'Proof of Activity,' is the definition of—and reward for—the active measures taken for survival. To survive in Endgame Protocol, every participant must periodically prove their 'activity.'
•	Definition of 'Activity': ‘Proof of Activity’ refers to any outbound transaction that resets a wallet’s inactive status. The protocol officially recognizes the following as 'activity':
o	Transaction: The act of sending any amount of [$EGP] tokens from your wallet to another.
o	Staking: The act of depositing [$EGP] tokens into, or withdrawing them from, the protocol's official staking contract
o	Governance Participation: The act of exercising voting rights on official proposals that determine the direction of the Endgame Protocol (to be activated according to the roadmap).
o	Ecosystem Interaction: The act of using [$EGP] tokens on DApp services that are officially partnered with the Endgame Protocol.
Upon the occurrence of any of these activities, the wallet's 30-day inactivity timer is immediately reset.
•	Rewards for Activity: The most fundamental and immediate reward is ‘survival’—receiving an exemption from the burn. However, Endgame Protocol goes beyond mere survival to offer greater honor and rewards to its most active participants.
o	Burn Exemption: A wallet that has proven its activity can safely preserve its assets until the next burn cycle.
o	Leaderboard Points: All activities are converted into differentiated scores based on their type and scale, which are then recorded on the real-time ‘Survivor Leaderboard.’ Top-ranking players on the leaderboard will be periodically granted special rewards (e.g., bonus tokens, limited edition NFTs, etc.). Through this, activity transcends being a simple defensive measure and becomes an offensive strategy to seize greater profits.

4.3.	The Third Law - Strategic Tools: Options for Victory 
Endgame Protocol does not merely compel a passive survival focused only on avoiding the burn. We provide a variety of strategic tools that players can use to achieve greater levels of wealth and honor. Depending on how you leverage these tools, you can transcend being a mere survivor and become a victor who dominates the state of play.
1.	Staking: Active Defense and Profit Maximization
Staking is the most critical defensive strategy in Endgame Protocol, and simultaneously, an offensive tool for generating stable returns. Players can deposit their [$EGP] tokens into the staking contract.
o	Burn Exemption: Assets deposited in the staking contract are considered 'active' and are therefore completely exempt from the weekly Burn rule. This is the most reliable method for protecting your assets over the long term.
o	Interest Yield: Staked tokens will generate yield according to a predetermined Annual Percentage Rate (APR). This transcends passive defense, becoming an act of actively growing your assets.
o	Strategic Choice: However, a mandatory 'unstaking' period is required to withdraw staked assets. This forces players to make a strategic trade-off between liquidity and stability.
2.	Leaderboard: The Proof of Honor and Wealth
All activity within the Endgame Protocol is transparently recorded, and the achievements of exceptional players are showcased on the ‘Survivor Leaderboard.’ The leaderboard is not merely a ranking table; it is a hall of fame that proves one's honor and wealth.
o	Fostering Competition: Rankings for various categories—such as 'Longest Survivor,' 'Most Active User,' and 'Top Staker'—are aggregated in real-time, igniting a competitive spirit among all participants.
o	Additional Rewards: Top-ranking players in each category will be periodically awarded special bonus rewards (e.g., airdrops, limited edition NFTs). This provides a powerful incentive for all players to strive to become the best, moving beyond mere survival.
3.	Future Update: Alliance: The Era of Collective Survival
The ultimate evolution of Endgame Protocol is its expansion beyond individual competition into an era of collective warfare. As outlined in the roadmap, an 'Alliance' system will be introduced to enhance community functionality.
o	Guild System: Players will be able to voluntarily form guilds, which will be known as 'Alliances' within the ecosystem.
o	Collective Strategy: Alliances will be able to execute various collective strategies that transcend the power of a single player, such as managing a common treasury, pursuing higher yields through group staking, and protecting members through coordinated activity. This will add a profound layer of strategic depth and political elements to the Endgame Protocol.

4.4.	The Fourth Law - Chaos & Opportunity: The Unpredictable Variables
Endgame Protocol is not confined to a static set of rules. To infuse the ecosystem with continuous tension and excitement, we introduce unpredictable events and new strategic variables. This will simultaneously present new opportunities and crises to all players, adding a profound layer of depth to the game.
1.	Limited-Time Special Event: 'The Pillage Night'
The core of Endgame Protocol is its unpredictability. Once a month, without warning, the 24-hour 'Pillage Night' event will begin.
This is not a new penalty. It is a window of opportunity for the swiftest players to seize the bounty placed on 'inactive wallets' that are already destined to be burned for breaking the rules.
Rules:
o	The Target: Only 'inactive wallets' with no activity for 30 days or more can be targeted for pillaging. You will never be pillaged for being inactive for just a single day.
o	The Hunt: During the event period, all active players can find and 'hunt' wallets that have become eligible targets.
o	Collateral: 
	To participate in the Night of Pillage and become a Bounty Hunter, a minimum of 100 EGP must be staked. This staked EGP serves as Collateral for the bounty hunting activity and simultaneously acts as a Stake for the distribution of bounty rewards
	The minimum staking requirement of 100 EGP is set to lower the barrier to entry for small holders, while simultaneously instilling a sense of responsibility for bounty hunting actions and preventing indiscriminate abuse
	Penalty: If a Bounty Hunter identifies a wallet that is, in fact, an active wallet, or attempts to execute bounty hunting in a manner detrimental to the system, a penalty mechanism will be applied where 50% of the staked EGP will be forfeited
o	The Reward: Upon a successful hunt, the amount that was scheduled to be burned on the next Burn Day (10% of the target's holdings) is immediately distributed.
	The Bounty Hunter receives half of this amount (5% of the target wallet's total holdings) as a reward. This reward pool will be distributed proportionally to the staked amount of all valid Bounty Hunters participating in the bounty hunting process.
	(Example: If a total of 10,000 EGP is designated for burning, 5,000 EGP becomes the bounty reward pool. If Bounty Hunter A staked 100 EGP and Bounty Hunter B staked 1,000 EGP, and both validly participated in the same bounty hunting process, A will receive (100 / 1,100) of the 5,000 EGP, and B will receive (1,000 / 1,100) of the 5,000 EGP.)
	The remaining half (5% of the target wallet's total holdings) will be immediately and permanently burned, removing it from the total supply.
Strategic Merit and Fun Factor:
o	New Playstyle (The Bounty Hunter): This event bestows a new role upon participants: the 'Bounty Hunter.' Players who analyze the activity status of others and are the first to 'hunt' wallets nearing inactivity can acquire immense wealth.
o	Increased Value of Information: A high-stakes information war unfolds where the knowledge of 'who is nearing an inactive state' becomes a direct path to profit. This will maximize the value of resources like the upcoming 'Shards of Foresight.'
o	Maintaining Ecosystem Health: This adds a layer of game-like fun to the rigid protocol rules and incentivizes players to voluntarily clear out 'sleeping assets,' thereby making the ecosystem more active and healthy.

2.	Strategic Items: 'Survivor's Sigil' (NFT)
Concept: To transcend simple token ownership, we are introducing NFT items with special abilities to add a profound layer of strategic depth.
Types and Acquisition Methods:
o	Sigil of Warding: Potion of Aegis (The Vaccine) 
	Effect: A single-use defensive item that, when held, protects the owner from one weekly Burn event.
	Acquisition: Awarded to top-ranking players on the leaderboard or airdropped at a very low probability for specific activities (e.g., making the 100th transaction).
o	Sigil of Absolution: Elixir of Salvation (The Cure)
	Effect: Even if a wallet has already entered an 'inactive' state, this NFT can be consumed to immediately reset the inactive status and avoid the upcoming weekly Burn.
	Acquisition: Awarded to loyal participants who have staked their tokens for a long duration (e.g., three months or more).
Strategic Merit & Engagement: 
o	Collection & Trading: These NFTs possess inherent scarcity and can be freely traded among users on NFT marketplaces like OpenSea. This creates a new layer of economic activity within the ecosystem.
o	Strategic Variables: This introduces a deep strategic variable, forcing players to weigh the critical decision: use the item at a crucial moment, or sell it for a high price on the open market.

3.	New Resource: 'Shards of Foresight'
Concept: To supplement the EGP token, we are introducing a new secondary resource used to acquire in-game information.
Acquisition Methods:
o	'Shards of Foresight' are generated daily, proportional to the duration and quantity of a player's staked tokens.
o	They are also distributed as rewards for community engagement, such as participating in governance votes and official events.
Use Cases:
o	'Pillage Night' Prediction: By consuming a certain amount of shards, players can check the probability of the next 'Pillage Night' event occurring.
o	Wallet Scan (Reconnaissance): Players can consume shards to check whether a specific wallet address is currently 'active' or 'inactive'.
Engagement Factor:
o	Monetization of Information: This provides an in-game experience where 'information' itself becomes a valuable, monetizable asset.
o	New Playstyles: This fosters diverse playstyles. Aggressive players will collect shards to scout and hunt others, while defensive players will use them to predict and prepare for threats.

5.	Tokenomics: An Economic System Designed for Growth
The economic system of Endgame Protocol, its tokenomics, is designed with the goals of sustainable value accrual and fair rewards for its participants. Everything is executed transparently by code, creating a structure where the token's value grows in tandem with the ecosystem.

5.1.	The Token's Core Design: The First Step Towards Scarcity 
	Name: Endgame Protocol
	Ticker: $EGP
	Blockchain: Binance Smart Chain (BSC)
o	Standard: BEP-20
o	Reasoning: The core of Endgame Protocol is 'continuous activity' from its participants. We believe that every player must be able to trade, stake, and execute survival strategies without being burdened by high fees. As of 2025, the Binance Smart Chain (BSC) is the most popular platform that is compatible with Ethereum's robust smart contract functionality while offering significantly lower gas fees and faster transaction speeds. To prevent high gas fees from discouraging player activity and to provide the most seamless and dynamic SuFi experience, we have chosen BSC as our mainnet.
	Initial Total Supply: 100,000,000 $EGP 
o	Issuance Philosophy: The total supply of Endgame Protocol is fixed at 100 million tokens from the start. We reject inflationary models that dilute token value through indiscriminate issuance.
o	The Core Principle - Reduction by Constant Burning: This 100 million supply is not a maximum limit, but a starting point. Through 'The Burn,' the core mechanism of Endgame Protocol, tokens from inactive wallets are permanently removed from the total supply every week. Therefore, the total amount of $EGP will continuously decrease (deflation) over time, serving as a powerful engine to naturally increase the scarcity and intrinsic value of the tokens held by the survivors.

5.2.	Token Distribution Policy: A Fair Launch and a Long-Term Vision
The total supply of 100,000,000 $EGP is strategically distributed to ensure the long-term, sustainable growth of the Endgame Protocol ecosystem. The entire distribution process will be made public to ensure transparency. Trust with our community is prioritized above all, especially concerning the team's allocation, which is subject to a long-term lock-up policy.
	Ecosystem & Rewards: 40%
o	Quantity: 40,000,000 $EGP
o	Purpose: This is the most critical allocation, serving as the lifeblood of the Endgame Protocol ecosystem. These funds will be used to reward participants who contribute directly to the ecosystem through activities such as staking, leaderboard achievements, community events, and the activation of the future Alliance system. This ensures the long-term vitality of the project and the continuous motivation of its participants.
	Presale: 20%
o	Quantity: 20,000,000 $EGP
o	Purpose: To offer community members who believed in and supported our vision from the beginning an opportunity to share in the fruits of the project's success. Funds raised from the presale will be used for the 'Initial Liquidity' and 'Marketing' allocations detailed below, establishing the foundation for a successful project launch.
	Initial Liquidity for DEX: 15%
o	Quantity: 15,000,000 $EGP
o	Purpose: To create a seamless and stable trading environment upon listing on a Decentralized Exchange (DEX). Sufficient initial liquidity reduces price volatility and ensures a trustworthy trading environment for participants. This liquidity will be permanently locked immediately after the listing to fundamentally prevent the possibility of a 'rug-pull' and provide a strong foundation of trust for the community.
	Team: 10%
o	Quantity: 10,000,000 $EGP
o	Purpose: This allocation is for the core development and operations team dedicated to turning the vision of Endgame Protocol into reality.
o	Vesting Conditions: The team's allocation is subject to strict vesting conditions to prove long-term commitment to the project. The tokens will be subject to a 1-year cliff, meaning they are fully locked for the first 12 months after the token listing. Following the cliff, the tokens will be distributed progressively on a monthly basis over 2 years (24 months). This is a powerful safeguard that ensures the team is focused solely on the long-term success of the project, not on short-term price fluctuations.
	Marketing: 5%
o	Quantity: 5,000,000 $EGP
o	Purpose: These funds are allocated to spread the vision of Endgame Protocol and SuFi to a global audience. They will be used for strategic partnerships, influencer collaborations, community expansion, and global campaigns to drive the sustainable growth of the ecosystem.
	Reserve: 10%
o	Quantity: 10,000,000 $EGP
o	Purpose: This allocation serves as a strategic reserve to address unforeseen market conditions, function as emergency funds, facilitate strategic partnerships, support development for new core features, or act as EGP loan collateral for the Multi-Asset Vault. This ensures the protocol's stability and flexibility are maximized, enabling agile responses to future growth opportunities.

5.3.	The Token's Core Value: Citizenship in the SuFi Nation
The $EGP token is not a mere digital asset. It is the citizenship and key currency of the grand digital economic nation that Endgame Protocol aims to build: the 'SuFi Nation.' To hold $EGP means to possess the right to participate in this nation's economic activities, to govern by directly shaping its laws, and to own a share of all the value generated from its growth.
1.	Right to Participate: The Key Currency of the SuFi World
$EGP is the center of all economic and gaming activities that occur within the SuFi ecosystem.
o	Survival Gameplay: It is the essential asset required to participate in the core survival game of Endgame Protocol and to engage in all activities such as staking, trading NFT items, and the 'Pillage Night.'
o	Use of the SuFi Hub: In the new SuFi games that will be launched through the future 'SuFi Launchpad,' $EGP will also be used as the key currency for item trading and rewards.
o	Marketplace Payments: It is used as the core payment method for all economic activities in the 'Gladiator's Marketplace,' such as betting on top players or trading verified strategy NFTs.
2.	Right to Govern: The Legislators and Investors of the Ecosystem
The $EGP token is the voting power of the Endgame Protocol DAO. Holders are not merely players; they become operators who decide the future of the ecosystem.
o	Internal Rule-Making: Decide on core economic systems and game rules through voting.
o	External Ecosystem Control: As the DAO evolves into the 'Survivors' Syndicate,' EGP holders will wield influence over the entire market by using the Ecosystem Fund to decide which new projects to invest in and which to provide with a 'SuFi Certified' audit.
o	Decision-Making Power: Holders of $EGP become members of the future Endgame DAO, granting them the right to vote on crucial proposals that will determine the protocol's destiny.
o	Key Proposal Agendas:
[Core Economic System Agendas]
	Adjustments to the Burn Rate (10%) and Inactivity Period (30 days)
	Changes to the Staking APR (Annual Percentage Rate)
	Decisions on the use of the Ecosystem Fund
[Advanced Gameplay Agendas]
	Adjustments to the 'Pillage Night' event frequency and hunt reward ratios
	Proposals for new types of 'Survivor's Sigil' NFTs or changes to their acquisition conditions
	Proposals for new use cases and generation rates for the 'Shards of Foresight'
	Decisions on the detailed rules for the future 'Alliance' system
o	Holding $EGP means more than just owning an asset; it means having the right to become an operator who determines the direction of the protocol.
3.	Right to Own: Beneficiaries of the Nation's Growth
The $EGP token is a 'proof of ownership' that absorbs all the economic value generated from the growth of the SuFi Nation.
o	Value Accrual: Through the continuous burn mechanism, the scarcity of the token increases, directly rewarding long-term holders with the value of the ecosystem's growth.
o	Revenue Sharing: Revenue generated by the 'Survivors' Syndicate' through external project investments or audit services will be distributed to EGP holders (DAO members), providing an experience where the success of the ecosystem becomes one's own success.
4.	Right to Economic Prosperity: The Core of Future Value Creation Endgame Protocol goes beyond the scarcity and activity of EGP to maximize the token's intrinsic value through practical utility and robust demand generation, thereby providing continuous economic prosperity to its participants.
o	Multi Asset Vault & DeFi Integration: We plan to build a Multi Asset Vault system where EGP holders can leverage their EGP as collateral or deposit external assets (BTC, ETH, Stablecoin, etc.) into the Vault to generate profit. We intend to utilize the assets deposited in the Vault to initiate loans within decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols and distribute the resulting interest margin to Vault participants. This mechanism will grant EGP strong collateral value and practical utility for generating revenue, significantly increasing the demand for purchasing and holding EGP.
o	Ecosystem DApp & Service Expansion: We plan to continuously expand the use cases for EGP by developing exclusive DApps and services that require EGP for access or offer special benefits.
o	Integrated Fee Model: We will introduce a model where EGP is used to pay fees for specific services within the Endgame Protocol ecosystem, and a portion of these fees will be either burned or redistributed to EGP holders, thereby continuously generating demand for EGP.
Thus, the utility of EGP is robustly designed around four pillars: participation, governance, ownership, and prosperity within the ecosystem, consistently underpinning the token's intrinsic value and solidifying its status as a citizen of the SuFi Nation.

6.	Technical Architecture: Designing a Trustworthy Decentralized System
The architecture of Endgame Protocol follows a modular design to maximize security, scalability, and transparency. Each distinct function is handled by an interconnected smart contract, and all core logic is deployed on the BNB Chain to be executed autonomously by code.
	EGP Token Contract (BEP-20 Standard)
o	Role: This is the standard contract that manages all basic functions of the protocol's key currency, the $EGP token, including its issuance, transfers, and ownership. It is built upon OpenZeppelin's battle-tested libraries to ensure stability.
	Game Master Contract
o	Role: This acts as the central logic controller—the brain—of Endgame Protocol. This contract executes the weekly 'Burn' logic, tracks the 'activity status' of all wallets, and governs global events like the 'Pillage Night.'
o	Interaction: It constantly communicates with other contracts, such as by querying the 'Staking Vault' to exempt certain wallets from the burn logic.
	Staking Vault Contract
o	Role: Serves as a safe vault where users can securely deposit (stake) their $EGP and receive rewards based on a predetermined interest rate. The generation logic for 'Shards of Foresight' is also contained within this contract.
o	Interaction: Guarantees that assets deposited within it are safe from the burn logic of the 'Game Master Contract.'
	Governance DAO Contract
o	Role: This is the decentralized parliament where $EGP holders can propose and vote on changes to the protocol's key variables (e.g., burn rate, interest rate).
o	Interaction: When a vote passes, this DAO contract holds the powerful authority to directly modify the core parameters of other contracts (like the Game Master and Staking Vault) via its owner privileges over them.
	NFT Contract (ERC-721/1155 Standard)
o	Role: Manages the issuance, ownership transfer, and burning (consumption) of strategic NFT items like the 'Survivor's Sigil.'
All of these interactions are transparently recorded on the blockchain for anyone to verify, establishing the technical foundation that allows the protocol to operate autonomously without the intervention of a central operator.

7.	Go-to-Market Strategy: In Search of the First Survivors
The success of Endgame Protocol depends not only on its innovative technology but also on how effectively we build a strong initial community that will be passionate about the new laws of this game. Our go-to-market strategy focuses on generating organic virality by precisely targeting key communities, rather than relying on massive capital expenditure.

7.1.	Phase 1: Forming the Strategists' Guild | Pre-Launch
	Objective: To form a core group of theorists who understand the game's depth and can lead early public opinion before the official launch
	Core Target: We are not looking for simple 'coin investors'; we are seeking 'gamers' and 'strategists.' Our primary targets are communities of deep strategy games (e.g., EVE Online, Civilization) and 'Degen' groups who find optimal yields in complex DeFi protocols.
	The EVE Online Community: "Experts in Betrayal and Survival"
o	High Risk, Permanent Loss: In EVE Online, losing a battle results in the permanent destruction of assets (spaceships) that may have taken months to acquire. These players are not only familiar with risks like 'The Burn' or 'Pillage'—they enjoy them as part of the thrill.
o	Complex Economic and Political Systems: The economy of EVE Online is 100% player-driven. Users form massive Alliances to wage war, betray each other, and engage in political maneuvering. Our 'Alliance' system and DAO governance are concepts that will be both familiar and highly appealing to them.
o	Masters of Information Warfare: In EVE, information is the most critical weapon. Scouting enemy locations and assessing asset values are basic survival skills. The 'Shards of Foresight' and 'Wallet Scan' features will be perceived by them as natural and essential strategic tools. 
EVE Online players will perceive Endgame Protocol not as a 'coin,' but as a 'new universe' and a 'new battlefield to be conquered.'
	The Civilization Community: "Masters of Long-Term Vision"
o	Long-Term Resource Management and Growth: Civilization players allocate resources and research technologies with a vision for hundreds of turns into the future, not just for immediate gain. They will adapt very quickly to our game's methods of pursuing long-term profits through 'staking' and the need for consistent activity to avoid 'The Burn.'
o	The Pursuit of Optimal Strategy: These players enjoy finding the optimal 'tech tree' and 'build order' to achieve victory in a given situation. They are highly likely to enjoy researching and sharing survival strategies within the community that yield the best efficiency among the various options like 'pillage,' 'staking,' and 'proof of activity.'
Civilization players will feel that Endgame Protocol is like a 'grand strategy game where the results are reflected in real-time' and will be fascinated by its strategic depth.
	Degen Group: "An aggressive group of investors who take on very high risks, analyzing new DeFi protocols or new coins faster than anyone else in pursuit of super-high returns." They are characterized by their skill in quickly understanding complex systems, finding loopholes, or extracting optimal efficiency.
	Action Plan: We will conduct private, invite-only AMAs (Ask Me Anything) with key influencers and power users from these communities, sparking discussions about the game-theoretical depth of our whitepaper to secure an initial support base.

7.2.	Phase 2: The First Survivors Campaign | Post-Launch 
	Objective: To maximize initial hype and create early 'successful player' stories to stimulate the competitive spirit of other participants.
	Core Target: Presale participants and the initial wave of new players.
	Action Plan: Presale participants will be awarded a limited-edition 'Genesis Survivor' NFT as a badge of honor. Additionally, we will run 'The First Survivor' event during the first month after launch, offering exceptional rewards to top players on the leaderboard to maximize initial ecosystem vitality.

7.3.	Phase 3: The SuFi Evangelist Program | Growth Stage
	Objective: To empower the community to become a powerful 'growth engine' that organically attracts new users.
	Core Target: Highly engaged community members with a deep understanding of the project.
	Action Plan: We will appoint members who create high-quality content—such as strategy guides, analytical articles, and video tutorials—as 'SuFi Evangelists' and reward them through the Ecosystem Fund. This community-generated content will become the most powerful and sustainable marketing tool for driving new user acquisition.

8.	Roadmap: The Journey to Survival 
Endgame Protocol has a clear vision and a systematic plan for execution. Our journey is comprised of four core phases, each designed to progressively build and expand the SuFi ecosystem.

8.1.	Genesis: Building the Foundation for SuFi
Objective: To build the perfect foundation for the birth of SuFi.
This phase is the most critical period for introducing the vision of Endgame Protocol to the world, securing technical stability, and establishing our initial community.
	Whitepaper v1.0 Release: We will publish the official whitepaper detailing the vision of Endgame Protocol and SuFi.
	Core Community Building: We will establish our official channels—Website, Twitter (X), Telegram, and Discord—to form an initial group of 'Survivors' who resonate with the project's vision.
	Smart Contract Development & Audit: We will complete the development of the smart contracts for the $EGP token and its core logic (burn, distribution) and have them 100% verified for stability through an audit by a global, top-tier security firm.
	Presale: We will conduct a presale for early supporters to secure the initial funding and a strong community foundation required for a successful launch.

8.2.	Ignition: Opening the Prelude to Competition
Objective: To make the ecosystem's heart beat and to raise the curtain on the first competition.
This is the phase where we will officially activate the economic system of Endgame Protocol and open the prelude to the SuFi game.
	Decentralized Exchange (DEX) Listing: We will list the $EGP token on PancakeSwap and provide sufficient initial liquidity to create an environment where anyone can trade freely and securely.
	First Burn Event: We will conduct the first 'Burn' event after the listing to prove to the community how the core mechanism of SuFi actually works.
	Survivor Leaderboard System Launch: We will launch the v1.0 of the Survivor Leaderboard on the official website to display real-time activity rankings, stimulating the competitive spirit of participants and injecting vitality into the initial ecosystem.

8.3.	Evolution: Beyond Mere Survival, Into a True Game
Objective: To add strategic depth and to advance into a wider world.
This is the phase where we move beyond mere survival, offering players more profound strategic choices and a broader market for trading.
	Staking System Launch: We will launch the official staking system, allowing players to avoid the burn and earn additional yield, thereby strengthening the long-term stability of the ecosystem.
	Centralized Exchange (CEX) Listing Initiative: We will pursue listings on highly reputable, global Top 20 centralized exchanges to make Endgame Protocol more accessible to a larger audience of participants.
	First Governance Vote: We will conduct the first official vote of the Endgame DAO. This will be a historic first step, where the community directly decides on the rules of the protocol (e.g., the leaderboard reward structure).

8.4.	New World: Beyond Individual Play, Into an Era of Collective Survival
Objective: To expand the SuFi ecosystem, moving beyond individual play and into collective competition.
This is the phase where we will expand Endgame Protocol beyond a simple token project into a grand digital nation and platform.
	Building the SuFi Hub: We will begin the development of a 'SuFi Launchpad,' enabling other developers to launch their own survival games using $EGP.
	Alliance System Development: We will develop and release a prototype of the 'Alliance System' to the community, enabling players to form guilds to cooperate and compete.
	Strategic Asset Expansion (Multi-Asset Vault): The Multi-Asset Vault of EGP transcends simple asset deposits. It introduces an innovative 'Asset-Backed EGP Loan' system, enabling Web3 holders to actively participate in the EGP Survival Economy without selling their core assets (such as BTC, ETH, NFTs, $CAKE, $BNB, etc.).
o	Asset Collateralization & EGP Borrowing: Holders of various project tokens can deposit their assets as collateral into the Vault. In return, they borrow EGP tokens from the protocol, equivalent to a certain percentage of their collateral's value. This mechanism generates organic and robust demand for EGP tokens.
o	Participation in the Survival Economy & Accelerated EGP Burning: The borrowed EGP tokens are then utilized to actively participate in EGP 's unique game-theoretic activities, such as the 'Night of Plunder.' The subsequent burning of EGP tokens during these activities maximizes EGP 's scarcity, thereby increasing the value of the entire ecosystem.
o	Value Defense through Liquidation Mechanism: Should the market value of the collateralized asset (e.g., BTC) decline and the Loan-to-Value (LTV) ratio exceed a predetermined threshold, a forced liquidation will occur. In this event, the liquidated collateral will be used to purchase and burn EGP tokens. This unique mechanism transforms external market risks into an opportunity for powerful EGP deflation, effectively defending and strengthening the overall value of the EGP ecosystem through liquidation.
This Multi-Asset Vault not only safely encompasses the assets of other project communities and integrates them into the EGP ecosystem but also serves as a core strategy for the exponential expansion of EGP 's value through organic EGP demand and strong deflation.
	Multi-Asset Vault Initial Implementation Strategy & Roadmap: Endgame Protocol's Multi-Asset Vault holds the innovative vision described above as its ultimate goal. However, for the sake of protocol stability, security, and efficient initial launch, a hybrid approach leveraging the infrastructure of established DeFi protocols will be adopted in the initial phase.
o	Initial Strategic Approach: EGP users will deposit their core assets (e.g., BTC, ETH, NFTs, $CAKE, $BNB) as collateral into trusted, large-scale DeFi lending protocols like Aave and Compound, and then borrow 'stablecoins' (e.g., USDC, USDT, DAI).
o	Driving EGP Survival Economy Participation: The EGP Protocol will provide strong incentives for users to utilize these borrowed stablecoins to purchase EGP tokens and actively participate in the 'Survival Economy' game. This process will generate indirect yet robust demand for EGP tokens.
o	Minimizing Risk and Ensuring Reliability: This approach fundamentally eliminates the substantial development burden, smart contract risks, and the potential 'borrowed token value depreciation' risk associated with EGP Protocol directly building and operating its own lending/liquidation system in the initial phase. This maximizes the trust of investors and the user community in the stability and security of the EGP project.
o	Long-Term Vision: As the EGP Protocol grows and its community matures, the development and operation of its own Multi-Asset Vault system will be pursued as a key objective in the long-term roadmap. Through this, EGP will ultimately achieve full autonomy and realize the vision of 'Asset-Backed EGP Lending' presented above.
	Launching the Gladiator's Marketplace: We will diversify the ecosystem's economic activity by introducing features for player-to-player (P2P) betting and the trading of strategy NFTs.
	Ecosystem Contributor Recognition (LP Staker Integration): We will recognize the act of staking EGP-BNB Liquidity Provider (LP) tokens as 'activity.' This will embrace core ecosystem contributors as players and incentivize the provision of liquidity.
	SuFi Ecosystem Expansion: Building on the success of Endgame Protocol, we will begin the research and planning for second and third projects that utilize the new genre of SuFi.
	Establishing the Survivors' Syndicate: We will expand the DAO's functionality, taking the first steps toward becoming a decentralized venture capital (VC) that invests in and audits external projects.

9.	Team & Partners: Turning the Vision into Reality
Endgame Protocol ultimately aims for a decentralized ecosystem, and this philosophy is deeply reflected in our team's operational principles. We strongly desire this project to grow through pure ideas, innovative mechanisms, and the collective intelligence of the community, rather than relying on the fame or background of specific individuals.
We prioritize the vision and technical capabilities of Endgame Protocol above all else, focusing all our efforts transparently and fairly on the project itself. We will prove our trustworthiness not through individual identities, but solely through our deliverables and code.
Furthermore, we view partnerships not merely as collaborations, but as strategic allies committed to jointly building and expanding the decentralized ecosystem of Endgame Protocol. Together with them, we are dedicated to constructing a robust and sustainable SuFi Nation.
	The Foundation of Trust: Code and Community
We believe that anonymity must not lead to a lack of accountability. Therefore, we are committed to the community and will build the highest level of trust through the following measures.
o	Transparent Smart Contract Audit: Endgame Protocol prioritizes the protection of community assets, committing to the highest standards of security and transparency. To achieve this, we adhere to the principle of undergoing a comprehensive code audit by a global Top Tier security auditing firm prior to the official project launch. We will conduct audits through such a premier enterprise, and the results will be 100% transparently disclosed to the community. The complete final audit report will be publicly accessible via our official website and GitHub. This process will allow us to prove to the community that our code has undergone objective verification by third-party experts, thereby establishing an environment where all participants can engage in the game with confidence.
o	Strict Team Vesting: The tokens allocated to the team are strictly locked via a smart contract under the condition of a 1-year cliff and a 2-year linear vesting period following the listing. This is a powerful commitment that proves we cannot disrupt the market for short-term gain and are dedicated solely to the long-term success of the project.
o	Community-driven Governance: The ultimate goal of Endgame Protocol is complete decentralization. As outlined in the roadmap, all operational authority will be transferred to a DAO (Decentralized Autonomous Organization) comprised of EGP holders. The future of the protocol will be decided not by an anonymous development team, but by the hands of the community itself.
We ask you to join us on this journey, believing not in the names of a team, but in well-written code, a healthy community, and the powerful vision of SuFi.

10.	Risk Factors
As Endgame Protocol presents an innovative model, it inherently contains the following potential risks. In accordance with our principle of transparency to the community, we clearly disclose these risks and will do our utmost to mitigate them.
•	Smart Contract Risk: Although we will undergo security audits from global top-tier firms, we cannot guarantee 100% perfect security. If an undiscovered vulnerability exists in the smart contract code, participants' assets could be at risk. We will mitigate this risk by undergoing multiple audits from various firms and operating a bug bounty program.
•	Game Theory Risk: The core of this protocol is based on the game-theoretical assumption that participants will act rationally and competitively. If the majority of participants behave in patterns entirely different from our projections, or in the event of extreme market conditions, the burn mechanism could produce unintended consequences. We have designed the system to respond to such situations by allowing the protocol's parameters to be adjusted via DAO governance.
•	Regulatory Risk: The regulatory landscape for cryptocurrency and DeFi is rapidly evolving and highly uncertain worldwide. Future laws or regulations from various governments could impact the operation of Endgame Protocol or the nature of the $EGP token. We will respond swiftly to changes in the regulatory environment through ongoing legal counsel.
•	Initial Community Building Risk: The value of Endgame Protocol depends on the active participation of its community. If we fail to attract a sufficient number of active players in the initial phase, there is a risk that the ecosystem could fail to activate and may stagnate. We will manage this risk through the precise, targeted marketing outlined in our 'Go-to-Market Strategy' chapter.

12.	Conclusion: Why Join SuFi Now?
Over the past few years, we have witnessed the birth and death of countless cryptocurrency projects. The era of HODL, inflated by vague expectations, has faded, and the mirage of GameFi, built upon unsustainable rewards, has vanished.
The market is now asking: "So, what's next?"
Endgame Protocol is the clearest and boldest answer to that question.
We do not make empty promises. Instead, we present a system proven by code. We are not proposing the passive accumulation of wealth; rather, we invite you into a dynamic world where your every action becomes value.
The core values of Endgame Protocol are clear:
•	The First: We are pioneering a new paradigm called 'Survival Finance (SuFi).' You will not be a simple early investor, but a Pioneer writing the first page of a new history.
•	Transparency: All our laws are published on the smart contract and apply fairly to everyone. There is no intervention from centralized entities or hidden rules. There is only the code.
•	Dynamism: Here, assets are no longer dormant. You will experience a living economy where your every strategy and action creates ripples throughout the ecosystem, and where value is ceaselessly regenerated through survival and competition.
This is more than an investment; it is an opportunity to prove your skill.
The era of entrusting your assets to the whims of the market is over. Now, you must seize value directly with your strategy, insight, and survival instinct. You are no longer a spectator, but a player who directly competes in the game and an operator who will shape the laws of this world.
We are not just creating a single game. We are building a complete digital economic nation founded upon the most primal laws of competition and survival, and EGP is the citizenship and the key currency of that nation.
Right now, the new laws of the game are waiting for you.
Survive and Prove.
